## Dot Game
The dot game is a game where two players have a grid of dots that can be pressed in. Each
row in the grid can have an arbitrary number of dots. On each player's turn, they can 
press in as many dots as they'd like, as long as the dots are within the same row. They must press in at least
one dot. Whichever player presses in the last dot loses.
